DICOM4QI is an open demonstration and connectathon with the purpose of evaluating interoperability of the image analysis tools and workstations, applied to exchange of the quantitative image analysis results using DICOM standard.

We call this activity "a connectathon", but this is not an _official_ IHE or RSNA connectathon. We use the word "connectathon" to describe the essence of the activity, and not our affiliation to official connectathons that are already established in the field.

DICOM4QI welcomes participation of the relevant tools independent of their origin (academic or commercial, open-source or not). The only requirement is to comply with the rules. Feedback on the formulation of the rules is welcomed from the participants!

Since 2015, DICOM4QI results have been presented at a Quantitative Imaging Reading Room (QIRR) of the Annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA).

The present document was created to help with the organization of the exhibit activity, and as such serves two purposes:

 1. to develop and document operating procedures, expectations and organize test datasets.
 2. to report the connectathon results.
