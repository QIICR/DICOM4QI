History
=======

In 2015, [Andrey Fedorov](http://fedorov.github.io) and [Daniel Rubin](https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/daniel-rubin) came up with an idea of a collaborative project with the goal of testing and improving [DICOM](http://dicom.nema.org/Dicom/about-DICOM.html) interoperability for communicating [quantitative image analysis results](https://peerj.com/articles/2057/) \(so called, "DICOM-QI connectathon"\). This led to a Quantitative Imaging Reading Room \(QIRR\) exhibit at the annual convention of the [Radiological Society of North America \(RSNA\)](http://rsna.org) in 2015. The goal of that exhibit was to demonstrate DICOM-based communication of the image segmentation results. You can see the summary of the exhibit results in [this poster](https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1619877.v1).

In 2016, a larger group assembled aiming to continue and expand the scope of the original 2015 RSNA/QIRR DICOM for Quantitative Imaging \(DICOM4QI\) connectathon. Following successful application for participation, RSNA 2016 QIRR will feature the new iteration of the connectathon.

Evolution of the DICOM4QI task set
----------------------------------

2015
^^^^

The scope of the initial iteration of DICOM4QI included only the DICOM segmentation objects.

2016
^^^^

Scope extended to include parametric maps and TID1500 structured reports.

2017
^^^^

Scope extended to include longitudinal datasets and DICOM tractography objects.
