The overall goal is to demonstrate interchange of the types of DICOM objects needed for quantitative imaging research. To participate, you do NOT need to support all of the object types and tasks listed in the following sections!

**To participate, you do not need to be physically present at RSNA!** You can submit your results for inclusion in this public resource. Those of us at RSNA will be happy to tell attendees about your tool, and refer them to you if there are further questions we cannot answer.

**If your platform has support for** _**any**_ **of the objects within the scope of DICOM4QI, we would love to hear from you and include your submission!**

For each type of DICOM object, we provide sample datasets that include imaging series and the derived DICOM dataset of the type in question. Note that you can also download all of the datasets used in DICOM4QI here: [http://slicer.kitware.com/midas3/folder/3771](http://slicer.kitware.com/midas3/folder/3771) \(choose "Download" on the right-hand side\)

All of the test data is also available as a shared folder on Dropbox [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/dy2e38c1hbyrmqe/AACM1DSglbJW0qzypIjZASH5a?dl=0).

Each participant is asked to complete the following tasks:

1. **Relevant features of the platform**: short narrative of how the platform implements support for the specific type of object, what features are implemented, what features are missing.
2. **Read task**: Demonstrate how the provided test dataset is consumed and presented to the platform user. In this task we aim to evaluate both the accuracy of interpreting the specific test dataset, and the end-user usability.
3. **Write task**: Generate a dataset of the type in question. The dataset will be used to test interoperability of your platform with the other platforms participating in the connectathon.

Your submission **must** include the details about the platform you used to generate the results \(name of the product/platform, version\). If your platform is available publicly, please include access instructions.

**If your platform and usage instructions are publicly available, you have the option to just send those to Andrey Fedorov, and he can do all the testing and populate the document content with the results.**

The details for the individual object types follow in the subsequent sections.
