# MeVisLab

1.**Description of the platform/product**:

* **name and version of the software**: MeVisLab 3.0
* **free?** yes [http://www.mevislab.de/download](http://www.mevislab.de/download)
* **commercial?** commercial licenses available on request
* **open source?** no \(only partially, sources included in above download\)
* **what DICOM library do you use?** custom \(MLDicomTree, using some headers from dcmtk\)

2.**Description of the relevant features of the platform**:

* **are both single and multiple segments supported?** yes \(reading\), single-only \(writing\)
* **how are the overlapping segments handled?** loaded separately 

  \(display depends on application\)

* **do you support both BINARY and FRACTIONAL segmentation types?**

  yes \(reading\), only binary supported for writing so far

* **do you render the segment using the color specified in the DICOM object?** yes / possible \(display depends on application\)
* **how do you communicate segment semantics to the user?** MeVisLab

  provides field interface, UI depends on application \(no application

  available yet using this new API as of November 2016\)

* **how do you support the user in defining the semantics of the object at the time segmentation is created?** 

  no support is available yet \(support similiar to the QIICR web

  interface planned, but not yet implemented\)

3.**Read task**: load each of the DICOM SEG datasets that accompany the imaging series into your platform

NB: MeVisLab is an IDE, not an end-user application.  Therefore, both  
the rendering of the lesion masks, as well as the display of the meta  
information entirely depend on the actual clinical application  
prototype. The screenshots below are from a custom MeVisLab network  
quickly put together just for this demonstration.

The underlying improved reading capabilities become available to all  
clinical applications and prototypes built using recent MeVisLab  
versions.  Work on integration into our internal "MeVisLab Application  
Framework", e.g. the extension of the object-relational mapping  
classes by SEG-relevant structures and the corresponding import code  
has begun, but it will take more work to produce nice frontends for  
end user-visible applications.

Reading-wise, the new module _MultiFileVolumeListSEGOutput_ has been  
implemented \(and will be shipped as part of the freely available  
FMEwork/ReleaseMeVis package together with MeVisLab\), which offers not  
only the segmentation mask \(for which the existing  
_MultiFileVolumeListImageOutput_ is sufficient\), but meta information  
about each selected segment.  Again, this information is provided as  
MeVisLab fields, extending the internal API by the necessary pieces  
for application support; these components are not directly visible to  
the end-user.

4.**Write task**

* segment the lung lesion using any method available in your platform; save the result as DICOM SEG; please include in the series description the name of your tool to simplify comparison tasks!
  * results are uploaded [in this folder](http://slicer.kitware.com/midas3/folder/4932)
* run [dciodvfy DICOM validator](http://www.dclunie.com/dicom3tools/dciodvfy.html); 

  iterate on resolving the identified issues as necessary

  * support for SEG writing \(in fact, support for writing multi-frame

    DICOM files\) has been newly introduced in MeVisLab

  * no remaining issues reported by `dciodvfy` \(except for Study attributes inherited from the input data\)

* run [dcentvfy DICOM validator](http://www.dclunie.com/dicom3tools/dcentvfy.html)
  * `PatientIdentityRemoved` and `DeidentificationMethod` tags are not properly copied from input data
