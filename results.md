# Results

Results are structured as follows. There is one section for each of the 3 types of objects: Segmentation, TID1500 Structured Report and Parametric Map.

As the results come in, in the beginning of each section, there will be a table summarizing the results for the individual tool. 

Following the summary, there will be one section per each tool with the details of the evaluation.

**NOTE**: at this time, only some of the sections are populated, as we are in the process of collecting responses from the participants.
