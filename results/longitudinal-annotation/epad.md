   * **hanging protocol**: user can select multiple studies in the search view and open them together using the eye icon. ePAD doesn't support any other hanging protocol specifications yet.
   * **plotting**: ePAD doesn't currently support plotting the changes in the measurements.
   * **handling multiple timepoints/measurements/findings**: ePAD shows a table of the time points using a filter for the measurements. The table has a summary section which calculates the response rate and category using the values that are seen on the table. User can view a specific annotation by clicking on the measurement value in that timepoint, or click on the name of the lesion to open annotations of that lesion on all timepoints.
