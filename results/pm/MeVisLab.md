# MeVisLab

Tasks for participants:

1. **Description of the platform/product**:
 * **name and version of the software**: MeVisLab 3.0
 * **free?** yes http://www.mevislab.de/download
 * **commercial?** commercial licenses available on request
 * **open source?** no (only partially, sources included in above download)
 * **what DICOM library do you use?** custom (MLDicomTree, using some headers from dcmtk)

 * **Description of the relevant features of the platform**: 
   MeVisLab is an IDE, not an end-user application.  The screenshots below are from a custom MeVisLab network quickly put together just in order to demonstrate the PM reading for this context (you can find the network and the accompanying [script](/results/pm/mevislab/pm_test.script) and [network](/results/pm/mevislab/pm_test.mlab)).  The demonstrated capability becomes available to all clinical applications and prototypes built using recent MeVisLab versions.
3. **Read task** (for each dataset!)
 * load each of the DICOM Parametric map datasets into your platform
 * submit a screenshot demonstrating the presentation of the loaded parametric maps to the user by email to Andrey Fedorov
