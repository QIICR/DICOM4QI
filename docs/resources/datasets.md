The following is the growing list of publicly available datasets that use DICOM for storing results of image analysis or interpretation:

* [TCIA QIN-HEDNECK collection](http://doi.org/10.7937/K9/TCIA.2015.K0F5CGLI):  whole body PET/CT images of patients before and after therapy. Includes SUV-correction, segmentations and segmentation-based measurements stored as DICOM SEG and SR for a subset of population. See details in this manuscript: https://peerj.com/articles/2057/.
* [TCIA NSCLC Radiogenomics collection](http://doi.org/10.7937/K9/TCIA.2017.7hs46erv): chest CT images and segmentations of nodules stored as DICOM SEG.
* [TCIA-LGG and TCIA-GBM collection segmentations](https://doi.org/10.7937/TCIA.2018.ow6ce3ml): segmentation of sub-structures of brain tumors stored as DICOM SEG objects.
* [TCIA QIN-Prostate-Repeatability collections ](http://doi.org/10.7937/K9/TCIA.2018.MR1CKGND): segmentations and segmentation-based measurements stored as DICOM objects for a dataset evaluating repeatability of multiparametric MRI in the prostate. See details in this manuscript: TBD (in press).
* [TCIA LIDC-IDRI segmentations and characterizations of lung nodules](https://doi.org/10.7937/TCIA.2018.h7umfurq): standardized representation of the annotations and nodule characterization for the LIDC project. See details in this manuscript: https://peerj.com/preprints/27378v1/.
* [Crowds Cure Cancer: Data collected at the RSNA 2017 annual meeting](https://doi.org/10.7937/K9/TCIA.2018.OW73VLO2): linear annotations of the maximum dimension of the tumor in a range of cancer types. Annotations are available as DICOM SR-TID1500 objects.
